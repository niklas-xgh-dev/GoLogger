# LogViper - Comprehensive Log Collection System üêç

LogViper is a robust Python-based log collection system designed to gather, process, and store system logs efficiently. It's built to handle a high volume of logs from various sources, with plans for significant expansion.

## Tech Stack

- üêç Python for core functionality
- üêò PostgreSQL for log storage
- üêß Systemd for service management

## Key Features

1. **Flexible Log Collection**
   - Currently collects system metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage)
   - Expandable to include more log sources (e.g., application logs, network logs)

2. **Efficient Data Processing**
   - Parses and structures log data for easy analysis
   - Scalable architecture to handle increasing log volumes

3. **Reliable Storage**
   - Utilizes PostgreSQL for durable and queryable log storage
   - Designed for high-volume write operations

4. **Automated Deployment**
   - Systemd service for automatic startup and crash recovery
   - Easy to deploy and manage on Linux systems

## Upcoming Enhancements

- Integration with more log sources (e.g., syslog, journald)
- Advanced log parsing and categorization
- Real-time log streaming capabilities
- Enhanced querying and visualization tools

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure your PostgreSQL connection in `config/.env`
4. Deploy as a systemd service using the provided service file
